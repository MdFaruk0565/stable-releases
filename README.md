Ubuntu AMD64 Binary Release: https://github.com/ndagnetwork/stable-releases/blob/master/ndag.tar.gz

The Windows X64 version is being prepared and will be uploaded when the work is completed. Exwallet will be cancelled and a full-node wallet will be adopted to support more RPC functions of the exchange. For example, GetNewAddress, SendCoinTo, and Listtransactions, 

GetNewAddress - Generate A New wallet address
SendCoinTo - Send coin to another address
Listtransactions - List all transactions that have occurred for an address or entire Wallet
